## 1. 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Sign up for GitHub Student Developer Pack**: Go to this website: [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
3. **Open in Codespace**: Click the "Code" button and select "Create codespace on main".
4. **Wait for Setup**: Codespace will install all dependencies automatically.
5. **Start Learning**: Open the `setup_lab.py` file and begin your work.

## 2. 🛠️ Environment Setup

- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered code completion and suggestions.
- **Python**: Latest stable Python version.
- **VS Code Extensions**: Python, Copilot and more.

### Verify Your Setup

    A --> C[Task 2: Statistics Function]
    A --> D[Task 3: Calculator Class]
    A --> E[Task 4: Sorting Algorithms]
    A --> F[Task 5: Search Algorithms]
    A --> G[Task 6: Data Structure]
    A --> H[Task 7: Benchmarking]
```

- All code for this lab is in `setup_lab.py`.
- Each task is clearly marked with comments and TODOs.
- Use Copilot and VS Code to help you complete each section.

## 4. 💡 How to Complete the Lab

1. **Read the comments and TODOs in `setup_lab.py`.**
2. **Complete each function or class as described.**
3. **Test your code using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the file.**
4. **Commit your changes with clear messages.**
5. **Push your work to GitHub.**

## 5. 📝 Submission Checklist

- [ ] All tasks in `setup_lab.py` are completed.
- [ ] Code is tested and runs without errors.
- [ ] Clear and descriptive commit messages.
- [ ] Pushed to your GitHub repository.

## 6. 🔧 Troubleshooting & Help

- **Copilot not working?** Make sure you are signed in to GitHub and have access.
- **Import errors?** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
- **Kernel issues?** Restart the Jupyter kernel or codespace.
- **Extension problems?** Reload the VS Code window.

If you need help:
- Use the GitHub Issues tab for technical problems.
- Ask questions during office hours.
- Collaborate with classmates (follow academic integrity guidelines).

---
## 7. 🤖 AI Programming Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive comments.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Provide context through docstrings.
- Break complex problems into smaller parts.
- Review and test AI-generated code before committing.
- Use type hints for better AI suggestions.
- Document your decision-making process.

---
## 8. 🎓 Academic Integrity

- AI tools are learning aids, not replacements for understanding.
- Always review and understand AI-generated code.
- Follow your institution's academic integrity policies.
- Give appropriate attribution when required.
